Implement a function that determines the 
maximum length of a subarray that can be 
removed from a given permutation array arr of 
length n such that the remaining array remains a 
non-empty permutation. 
The function getMaximumSubarray will take one 
input: 
int arr[nl: the elements of arr. 
The function should return an integer denoting 
the maximum length of a subarray that can be 
removed. 
Note: 
• A subarray of an array is a contiguous 
segment of the array. 
• A permutation of length n is a sequence 
consisting of all integers from 1 to n exactly 
once in any order. 

Example 
N = 3
arr= [3, 1, 2] 
Some possible subarray removals 
Range of deletion(O-based 
indexing) 
before 
after 
[3] 
Is this a 
permutation? 
No 
Yes 
No 
The underlined elements represent the subarray that is removed. 
Hence, the maximum length of a subarray that can be removed is 1. 
Constraints 
1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10 and the exponent is 5
onstraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5). If you're seeing a different result or have another test case, plea


1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
