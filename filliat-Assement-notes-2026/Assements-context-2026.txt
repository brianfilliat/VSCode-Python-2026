PROBLEM 1: Mike's Lemonade Stand



COMPLETE SESSION OUTPUT - February 5, 2026


COMPLETE SESSION OUTPUT - February 5, 2026
please copy session output into a text file, insert-mm-dd-2026  session_output.txt


The user wants me to copy the entire session output into a text file. I need to check if the session_output.txt file already exists and either update it or create a new one with all the questions and answers from this session.

Looking at the conversation, I've answered many questions since the last time I created session_output.txt. I should create a comprehensive file with all the new questions and answers from this extended session.

Let me compile all the questions and answers since the original session_output.txt was created.














Let me count the digit 1 in numbers from 1 to 30:

Ones place: 1, 11, 21 → 3 times

Tens place: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 → 10 times

Total: 3 + 10 = 13 times
