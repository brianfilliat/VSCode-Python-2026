- Public Cloud AMERICAS (AWS N. Virginia)
- Public Cloud Asia Pacific (AWS  Singapore)
- Public Cloud EMEA (AWS Frankfurt)

Purpose:

- This folder contains vendor training materials and CloudFormation examples used for internal training and reference.

Important notes / Do Not Merge:

- DO NOT MERGE this folder into `main` or include it in production branches. It is an imported archive for reference only.
- Keep this folder separate for archival and training use; prefer creating a dedicated documentation repository if publishing is required.
- Before running any scripts or templates, review for sensitive data and confirm licensing/ownership.

If you need this content published or reorganized into a standalone repository, request a separate task to:

1. Create a new GitHub repo for training docs.
2. Add LICENSE and ownership metadata.
3. Add a lightweight site or MkDocs index for browsing.
