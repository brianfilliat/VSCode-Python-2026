## Problem Solution Format

Each solution file follows this naming convention:
- `problem_name.py` - Contains the solution code
- Include problem URL and description as comments at the top of each file

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the appropriate category folder
2. Each Python file contains:
   - Problem description and URL as comments
   - Solution implementation
   - Example test cases (if applicable)

## Running Solutions

To run any solution:

```bash
python3 path/to/problem_name.py
```

## Contributing

When adding new solutions:
1. Place the solution in the appropriate category folder
2. Use descriptive file names matching the problem title
3. Include problem description and HackerRank URL in comments
4. Format code following PEP 8 style guidelines
5. Add test cases when possible

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
