Implement a function that determines the 
maximum length of a subarray that can be 
removed from a given permutation array arr of 
length n such that the remaining array remains a 
non-empty permutation. 
The function getMaximumSubarray will take one 
input: 
int arr[n] the elements of arr 

The function should return an integer denoting 
the maximum length of a subarray that can be 
removed. 
Note: 
• A subarray of an array is a contiguous 
segment of the array. 
• A permutation of length n is a sequence 
consisting of all integers from 1 to n exactly 
once in any order. 


Example 
n=3
arr = [3, 1, 2] 
Some possible subarray removals 
Range of 
deletion(O- 
indexing) 
before 
after 
[2] 
[3 
Is this a 
permutation 
The underlined elements represent the subarray 
that is removed. 
Hence, the maximum length of a subarray that  can be removed is 1. 
Constraints 
1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10 and the exponent is 5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
Input Format for Custom Testing 
The first line contains an integer n, the size of 
arr. 
Each of the next n lines contains an integer 
arr[i]

The underlined elements represent the subarray 
that is removed. 
Hence, the maximum length of a subarray that 
can be removed is 3.
