PROBLEM 1: Mike's Lemonade Stand
---------------------------------
Question: Mike can sell 20 glasses of lemonade for 10 cents per glass. If he raises the 
price to 20 cents per glass, he estimates he can sell only 15 glasses. If so, how 
much more money will Mike make by charging 20 cents instead of 10 cents per 
glass?

Answer: At 10 cents per glass: 20 × $0.10 = $2.00
At 20 cents per glass: 15 × $0.20 = $3.00

Mike will make $1.00 more by charging 20 cents per glass.

PROBLEM 2: Martin's Can
---------------------------------
Question: Martin has an empty can. If he fills the can completely with sand, it weighs 
780 grams. If he fills just half of the can with sand, it weighs 590 grams. How 
much does the empty can weigh?

Answer: Let me solve this algebraically:

Let c = weight of empty can, and s = weight of full sand

From the given information:
- Full can: c + s = 780
- Half full: c + s/2 = 590

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
(c + s) - (c + s/2) = 780 - 590
s/2 = 190
s = 380 grams

Substituting back:
c + 380 = 780
c = 400 grams

The empty can weighs 400 grams.

PROBLEM 3: Football Competition
---------------------------------
Question: In a football competition there are 4 teams. Each team plays each other once. 
What is the total number of matches played?

Answer: Each team plays every other team once. This is a combination problem.

With 4 teams, we need to find the number of unique pairs:
- Team 1 plays: Teams 2, 3, 4 (3 matches)
- Team 2 plays: Teams 3, 4 (2 matches)
- Team 3 plays: Team 4 (1 match)

Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 matches

Or using the formula: C(4,2) = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6

PROBLEM 4: Dice Probability
---------------------------------
Question: If 2 dice are thrown together, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7?

Answer: When throwing 2 dice:
- Total possible outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36

Ways to get a sum of 7:
- (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) = 6 ways

Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 (or approximately 0.167 or 16.7%)

PROBLEM 5: Joshua's Number Writing
---------------------------------
Question: Joshua wrote down every number from 1 to 30. How many times did he write 
the digit 1?

Answer: Let me count the digit 1 in numbers from 1 to 30:

Ones place: 1, 11, 21 → 3 times

Tens place: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 → 10 times

Total: 3 + 10 = 13 times
