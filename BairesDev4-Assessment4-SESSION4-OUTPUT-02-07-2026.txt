================================================================

Q1: MapReduce Framework - Reduce Function Purpose
Question: In the Map Reduce framework, what is the purpose of the Reduce function?
Answer: It aggregates the results of the Map function and generates processed output
Explanation: The Reduce function receives grouped intermediate results (by key) from the Map phase and aggregates/combines them to produce the final output.

================================================================

Q2: Confidence Intervals
Question: Which of the following is not true about the effects of the width of confidence interval?
Answer: Confidence interval is not used for decision making
Explanation: This is FALSE - confidence intervals ARE widely used for decision making. The other statements are true: as confidence level increases, width increases; wide CIs provide less useful information.

================================================================

Q3: Measures of Central Tendency
Question: Which of the following measures of central tendency will always change if a single value in the data changes?
Answer: Mean
Explanation: The mean always changes when any value changes because it's the sum divided by count. Median and mode may remain unchanged depending on which value changes.

================================================================

Q4: Sample vs Population Variance
Question: If the variance of a dataset is correctly computed with the formula using (n-1) in the denominator, which option is true?
Answer: Dataset is a sample
Explanation: Sample variance uses (n-1) in the denominator (Bessel's correction), while population variance uses n.

================================================================

Q5: YARN Federation
Question: Which of the following is not true about Yarn?
Answer: Federation does not allow to transparently wire together multiple yarn (sub-)clusters
Explanation: This is FALSE - YARN Federation DOES allow transparently wiring together multiple sub-clusters to appear as a single massive cluster.

================================================================

Q6: Apache Hive
Question: Which of the following options is true about Hive?
Answer: Multiple statements are true, but most fundamental: Hive table definitions, mappings and other metadata are stored in Metastore
Additional true statements:
- SerDe stands for "Serializer and Deserializer"
- Alter statement allows changing column data types
- Row-level operations historically limited but improved with ACID support

================================================================

Q7: Spark SQL Domain-Specific Language
Question: Spark SQL provides a domain-specific language to manipulate ___?
Answer: DataFrames (None of the mentioned options if they don't include DataFrames)
Explanation: Spark SQL provides DSL for DataFrames and Datasets in Scala, Java, or Python.

================================================================

Q8: Spark Performance vs MapReduce
Question: Which of the following is the reason for Spark being faster than MapReduce?
Answer: DAG execution engine and in-memory computation (RAM based)
Explanation: Spark's in-memory processing (up to 100x faster) and DAG-based optimization provide significant performance advantages over MapReduce's disk-based processing.

================================================================

Q9: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) - Effect of k Value
Question: In k-NN what will happen when you increase/decrease the value of k?
Answer: The boundary becomes smoother with increasing value of K
Explanation: Small k leads to complex, irregular boundaries (overfitting); large k leads to smoother, more generalized boundaries.

================================================================

Q10: Logistic Regression
Question: Which of the following is not true about logistic regression?
Answer: The coefficients are estimated using maximum a posteriori estimation
Explanation: This is FALSE - standard logistic regression uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), not MAP.

================================================================

Q11: Classifier Performance Evaluation
Question: Which of the following is not a method used to evaluate the performance of a classifier?
Answer: Resubstitution Estimate
Explanation: While technically "used," it's not a valid method as it tests on training data, giving overly optimistic results. Valid methods: Holdout, Random Subsampling, Cross-Validation.

================================================================

Q12: Feature Scaling
Question: Which of the following is not true about Feature Scaling?
Answer: Scaling is not a monotonic transformation
Explanation: This is FALSE - scaling IS a monotonic transformation that preserves the order of values.

================================================================

Q13: Ensemble Learning
Question: Which algorithm is not an example of ensemble learning?
Answer: Decision Trees
Explanation: Decision trees are individual models. Random Forest, Adaboost, and Extra Trees are ensemble methods that combine multiple models.

================================================================

Q14: k-NN Distance Metrics
Question: Which distance metric can not be used in k-NN?
Answer: All can be used
Explanation: Manhattan, Minkowski, Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Tanimoto, and Jaccard can all be used in k-NN depending on data type.

================================================================

Q15: Confusion Matrix Analysis
Given confusion matrix (n=165):
                Predicted: NO    Predicted: YES
Actual: NO           50              10
Actual: YES           5             100

Answer: Accuracy = 0.91, Sensitivity = 0.95, Specificity = 0.83
Calculations:
- Accuracy = (100+50)/165 = 0.91
- Sensitivity (TPR) = 100/(100+5) = 0.95
- Specificity (TNR) = 50/(50+10) = 0.83

================================================================

Q16: Null Hypothesis
Question: What is an example of a null hypothesis?
Answer: A newly created model does not provide better predictions than the currently existing model
Explanation: The null hypothesis assumes no effect, no difference, or no improvement - representing the status quo.

================================================================

Q17: Hadoop MapReduce Job Troubleshooting
Question: MapReduce job submitted successfully but not completing - what to check?
Answer: Ensure that the Task Tracker is running
Explanation: Job submission works (JobTracker OK), but execution requires TaskTrackers on worker nodes to run the actual tasks.

================================================================

Q18: MapReduce Suitability
Question: For which class of problem is MapReduce most suitable?
Answer: Embarrassingly parallel
Explanation: Problems that can be divided into independent parallel tasks with minimal dependencies are ideal for MapReduce.

================================================================

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
================================================================

Q19: Local Variables
Question: A local variable ___?
Answer: Is declared within a method
Explanation: Local variables have scope limited to the method/block where they're declared.

================================================================

Q20: Method Overloading
Question: Defining 2 methods with the same name but different parameters is called?
Answer: Overloading
Explanation: Method overloading allows multiple methods with same name but different parameter lists.

================================================================

Q21: Polymorphism
Question: Polymorphism occurs when the child class methods ___?
Answer: Maintain the same parent class return value and arguments but are implemented differently
Explanation: Method overriding maintains the same signature but provides different implementation (runtime polymorphism).

================================================================

Q22: Private Attribute Access
Question: If an attribute is private, which methods have access to it?
Answer: Only those defined in the same class
Explanation: All methods (instance, static, class) within the same class can access private attributes.

================================================================

Q23: Derived Class Concept
Question: The concept of "derived class" means it's related to?
Answer: Inheritance
Explanation: A derived class (child/subclass) inherits from a base class (parent/superclass).

================================================================

Q24: Inheritance Purpose
Question: Inheritance is a way of ___?
Answer: Add features to existent classes without having to rewrite them
Explanation: Inheritance enables code reuse and extension without modifying the original class.

================================================================

Q25: Encapsulation
Question: What concept allows details in a class to not be visible for other classes?
Answer: Encapsulation
Explanation: Encapsulation bundles data and methods together while hiding internal details through access modifiers.

================================================================

Q26: Abstraction
Question: Which allows you to extract only necessary information from an object?
Answer: Abstraction
Explanation: Abstraction shows only essential features while hiding technical/implementation details.
