## Answer Key Highlights

**Most Challenging Topics:**
1. YARN Federation (NOT true statement identification)
2. Resubstitution Estimate (Invalid evaluation method)
3. Feature Scaling monotonicity (Correct understanding required)
4. Logistic Regression coefficient estimation (MLE vs MAP)

**Common Patterns:**
- 8 "NOT true" questions (identify false statement)
- 6 OOP fundamental definitions
- 5 "Best practice" selections
- 7 Technical architecture questions

**Perfect Score Tips:**
- Read questions carefully for "NOT true" vs "true"
- Understand technical distinctions (MLE vs MAP, Sample vs Population)
- Know when concepts apply (which distance metrics for k-NN)
- Differentiate similar concepts (Encapsulation vs Abstraction)
