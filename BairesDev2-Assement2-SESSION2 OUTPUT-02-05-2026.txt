PROBLEM 1: Mike's Lemonade Stand
---------------------------------
Question: Mike can sell 20 glasses of lemonade for 10 cents per glass. If he raises the 
price to 20 cents per glass, he estimates he can sell only 15 glasses. If so, how 
much more money will Mike make by charging 20 cents instead of 10 cents per glass?

Answer: At 10 cents per glass: 20 × $0.10 = $2.00
At 20 cents per glass: 15 × $0.20 = $3.00
Mike will make $1.00 more by charging 20 cents per glass.

==========================================

PROBLEM 2: Martin's Can
---------------------------------
Question: Martin has an empty can. If he fills the can completely with sand, it weighs 
780 grams. If he fills just half of the can with sand, it weighs 590 grams. How 
much does the empty can weigh?

Answer: Let c = weight of empty can, and s = weight of full sand
From the given information:
- Full can: c + s = 780
- Half full: c + s/2 = 590

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
(c + s) - (c + s/2) = 780 - 590
s/2 = 190
s = 380 grams

Substituting back:
c + 380 = 780
c = 400 grams

The empty can weighs 400 grams.

==========================================

PROBLEM 3: Football Competition
---------------------------------
Question: In a football competition there are 4 teams. Each team plays each other once. 
What is the total number of matches played?

Answer: Each team plays every other team once. This is a combination problem.
With 4 teams, we need to find the number of unique pairs:
- Team 1 plays: Teams 2, 3, 4 (3 matches)
- Team 2 plays: Teams 3, 4 (2 matches)
- Team 3 plays: Team 4 (1 match)

Total: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 matches
Or using the formula: C(4,2) = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6

==========================================

PROBLEM 4: Dice Probability
---------------------------------
Question: If 2 dice are thrown together, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7?

Answer: When throwing 2 dice:
- Total possible outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36
Ways to get a sum of 7:
- (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) = 6 ways

Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 (or approximately 0.167 or 16.7%)

==========================================

PROBLEM 5: Joshua's Number Writing
---------------------------------
Question: Joshua wrote down every number from 1 to 30. How many times did he write 
the digit 1?

Tens place: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 → 10 times
Total: 3 + 10 = 13 times

==========================================

PROBLEM 6: Sequence Pattern
---------------------------------
Question: Find the next number in the sequence: 10, 37, 82, 145, 226

Answer: Looking at differences: 27, 45, 63, 81 (increasing by 18 each time)
Next difference: 81 + 18 = 99
Next number: 226 + 99 = 325

The pattern follows the formula 9n² + 1

==========================================

PROBLEM 7: Sequence with Negatives
---------------------------------
Question: Find the next number in the sequence: 1, 1, 2, -1, 1, -2, -1

Answer: Using recurrence relation a(n) = -a(n-4) + a(n-2) for n ≥ 5:
a(8) = -a(4) + a(6) = -(-1) + (-2) = 1 - 2 = -1
The next number is -1.

==========================================

PROBLEM 8: Luke's Balls
---------------------------------
Question: Luke has blue and red balls. Every day, he wins 2 blue balls and loses 3 red 
ones. After 5 days, he has the same amount of blue and red balls. After 9 
days, he has twice as many blue balls as red balls. How many red balls did he 
have at the beginning?

Answer: Let b = initial blue balls, r = initial red balls
After 5 days: b + 10 = r - 15, so b = r - 25
After 9 days: b + 18 = 2(r - 27), so b = 2r - 72

From equations: r - 25 = 2r - 72
47 = r

Luke had 47 red balls at the beginning.

==========================================

PROBLEM 9: Football Tournament - 567 Teams
---------------------------------
Question: 567 teams participate in a football tournament. If each team plays against

==========================================

PROBLEM 10: Team Olympus
---------------------------------
Question: In a football tournament, each team plays exactly 19 games. Teams get 3

Team Olympus got a total of 28 points. From the following options, how many 
times could Team Olympus have tied?

Answer: Let w = wins, t = ties, l = losses
w + t + l = 19
3w + t = 28

Valid solutions: w ∈ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Team Olympus could have tied: 1, 4, 7, 10, or 13 times

letters that John has to send to be sure that Peter receives his letter?

Answer: 4-digit multiples of 70 (multiple of 5 and 7, ending in 0)

Answer: Testing each scenario where exactly one message is true:
If gold is in Box 3:
- Box 1: TRUE (gold not in Box 2)
- Box 2: FALSE (gold not in Box 2)
- Box 3: FALSE (gold IS in this box)

PROBLEM 18: Coins and Dice Probability
---------------------------------
Question: I toss 3 coins and roll 2 dice. What is the probability that all coins land tails or 
the dice sum to 10, regardless of whether one or both events occur?

Answer: P(A) = all tails = 1/8
P(B) = dice sum to 10 = 3/36 = 1/12
P(A ∩ B) = 1/8 × 1/12 = 1/96
P(A ∪ B) = 1/8 + 1/12 - 1/96 = 19/96 (approximately 0.198 or 19.8%)
